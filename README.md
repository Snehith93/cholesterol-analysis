# Cholesterol Analysis

## Introduction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`cholesterol_analysis.ipynb`) that explores a dataset of cholesterol levels along with other health-related variables. The analysis includes visualizations, regression models, and anomaly detection, providing insights into the factors influencing cholesterol levels.

## Analyses Included

### 1. **Visualizations**:
   - Descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the distribution of cholesterol levels by age, gender, and other factors.

### 2. **Regression Models**:
   - Simple Linear Regression to identify the relationship between age and cholesterol levels.
   - Multiple Linear Regression to understand the impact of age, resting blood pressure, max heart rate, and sex on cholesterol levels.

### 3. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Implementation of the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalies within the dataset, uncovering unique or medically significant patterns.

## Results and Conclusion
The analyses reveal complex relationships between cholesterol levels and various demographic and medical features, with age and gender emerging as key influencing factors. The detection of anomalies adds further depth, highlighting potential outliers or specific risk factors. The findings may have implications for healthcare professionals in predicting cholesterol levels and tailoring interventions.
